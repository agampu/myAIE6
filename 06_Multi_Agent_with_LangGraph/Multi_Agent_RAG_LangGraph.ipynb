I had to guide it to first go to the source and get the paper info and then it did Superviser->Paper->Supervisor->search->Supervisor->FINISH Curiously, I had to use the word \"absolutely\" to force it to use both.\n",

        "We're thrilled to share a groundbreaking achievement in the field of large language models (LLMs)! A recent study titled \"Extending Llama-3’s Context Ten-Fold Overnight\" has successfully expanded the context length of Llama-3 from 8K to a staggering 80K tokens using QLoRA fine-tuning. This enhancement was accomplished in just eight hours on a single 8xA800 (80G) GPU machine, demonstrating both efficiency and effectiveness in model training.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔍 This remarkable advancement not only improves Llama-3’s performance across various benchmarks such as NIHS, topic retrieval, and long-context language understanding, but also preserves the model's ability to generalize beyond its training contexts, handling up to 128K tokens. This capability makes it a formidable tool in processing extensive textual information, pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve.\n",
        "\n",
        "📊 Evaluated on LongBench and InfiniteBench, the model consistently outperformed baselines, setting a new standard in the field. Although it faced challenges in code completion tasks, the overall results are overwhelmingly positive.\n",
        "\n",
        "🌐 The full resources, including the model, training data, and code, are now publicly available, providing an invaluable asset for further research in training long-context LLMs.\n",
